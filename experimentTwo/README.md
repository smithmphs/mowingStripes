As in experiment one, a bent grass green was selected and high-resolution pictures were taken of patches of turf in the alternating mowing stripes.  The orientationj plug-in of imagej was then used to calculate the dominant angles.  The results are shown in the annotated picture below.  As you can see, the grass in the lighter stripes was generally (but not always) more bent toward the observer relative to the grass in the adjoining dark stripes.
