No stripes were photographed in this experiment.  Instead, the same swatch of turf was photographed at four different angles, the operator rotating 90 degrees three times in succession.  The dominant angle was then calculated using orientationj with the results shown in the figure below.

As you can see, the dominant angle of the grass changed as expected within a certain tolerance for experimental variability.  The original raw images are available in this directory.
