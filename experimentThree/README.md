No stripes were photographed in this experiment.  Instead, the same swatch of turf was photographed at four different angles in ninety degree rotations.  The dominant angle was then calculated using orientationj as shown in the figure below.
As you can see, the angles changed as expected within a certain tolerance for experimental variability.
