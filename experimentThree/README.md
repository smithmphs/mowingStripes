No stripes were photographed in this experiment.  Instead, the same swatch of turf was photographed at four different angles in rotation of 90 degrees.  The dominant angle was then calculated using orientationj with the results shown in the figure below.

As you can see, the dominant angle ofthe grass changed as expected within a certain tolerance for experimental variability.  The original raw images are available in this directory.
