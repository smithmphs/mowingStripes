<p align=center>Statistical Mechanics of Mowing Stripes on Golf Course Greens</p>


Consider the greensmower below.

See the mowing stripes his mower is creating in the background? Folklore says these stripes are due to differences in how the grass is bent. The folklore is probably true but nobody has proven it, much less examined the underlying statistics. So our aim here to do just that by collecting high-resolution pictures of mowing stripes and looking for correlations in the trajectories of the individual grass blades contained therein.  You can view our first attempt [here](experimentOne/README.md).  The next time you play a round, consider taking some pictures and sending them our way.  Together we will figure this out.  Thanks.
